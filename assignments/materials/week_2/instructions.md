# Assignment 2: Corpus Collection

## Prerequisites:
 - Basic understanding of scraping in Python
   - If you don't have this after completing the tutorial, I recommend completing the "Intermediate Importing Data in Python: Importing data from the Internet chapter" assignment in the [DataCamp course](https://app.datacamp.com/groups/man-7916-text-analysis-methods-9a2c4a02-a646-4664-b12f-83ae3ca6b350/dashboard) before proceeding.
 - Basic understanding of API access with Python
   - If you don't have this after completing the tutorial, I recommend completing the "Intermediate Importing Data in Python: Interacting with APIs to Import data from the web chapter" assignment in the [DataCamp course](https://app.datacamp.com/groups/man-7916-text-analysis-methods-9a2c4a02-a646-4664-b12f-83ae3ca6b350/dashboard) before proceeding.

## Part 1 - Set up your Assignment 2 environment

1. Create a new folder in your `assignments/submissions` folder called `assignment_2`
2. In this folder, create new Python scripts (either normal Python(.py) or Jupyter(.ipynb) scripts) for the next two parts:
   1. `dean_scraping.py`/`dean_scraping.ipynb`
   2. `ten_years_api.py`/`ten_years_api.ipynb`

## Part 2 - What is the Dean thinking?

You want to stay abreast of what Dean Jarley is thinking, but you don't have time to read all of his blog posts (although he hasn't posted in a while, so you probably could). You decide to scrape the [dean's blog](https://pauljarley.wordpress.com/) to get the text of his posts. Don't worry about getting *all* of the posts, just get the first page of posts.

With the first python file, create a script that:

1. Visits the landing page for the dean's blog and scrapes the following information:
    * The title of the post
    * The date of the post
    * The url of the post
2. Visits each of the urls from the previous step and scrapes the following information:
    * The text of the post
    * The comments
      * The author of the comment
      * The text of the comment
3. Saves the information to a CSV file titled "dean_scraping.csv" in the assignment_2 folder

The CSV file should have the following columns and look something like:

| title | url | entry_date | post_text | comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| We Should All Toss Something into the Tip Jar | https://pauljarley.wordpress.com/2024/10/21/we-should-all-toss-something-into-the-tip-jar/ | 2024-10-21T03:04:00-04:00 | "This is the text of the post" | Commenter 1: Their Comment \n Commenter 2: Their Comment |

## Step 3 - Ten Years of Subfield Journal Publications

With the second Python file, create a script that accomplishes the following:

1. Choose three journals in your subfield of interest (e.g., OB, Strategy, Entrepreneurship)
2. Use the CrossRef API to get a list every article they have published since Jan. 1, 2016. Retrieve the following fields:
   1. DOI
   2. Title
   3. Number of references
   4. Number of authors
   5. Number of citations
   6. URL
   7. Journal
   8. Abstract (where present)
   9. Publication year
3. Save the information to a CSV file titled "ten_years_api.csv" in the assignment_2 folder
4. Use this dataset to:
   1. Calculate the correlation between publication year and citation count
   2. Calculate an ANOVA showing whether there are mean differences in citation count by journal.
   3. Save the results of the correlation and ANOVA analyses to "publication_stats.txt" in the assignment_2 folder

The CSV file should have the following columns and look something like:

| doi | title | n_refs | n_authors | n_cites | url | journal | abstract | pub_year |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10.1016/j.jbusvent.2021.106175 | Failed but validated? The effect of market validation on persistence and performance after a crowdfunding failure | 152 | 3 | 17 | http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusvent.2021.106175 | Journal of Business Venturing | (abstract text) | 2022 |

### Three levels of difficulty for this part of the assignment - go with the one that is most appropriate for your skill/aspiration level:

* Level 1 (easy but time-consuming): Go one journal-year at a time and aggregate the results into a single CSV file. This is the approach is closest to what we did in the tutorial, but it will take more time to complete and is not scalable for actual research. I don't recommend this approach unless you are very new to Python and want to take it slow. You can also use this approach to test your code before moving on to Level 2.
* Level 2 (medium): Use nested loops to iterate through the journals and years, making the API calls and aggregating the results into a single CSV file. This will be faster than Level 1, but will require more coding and understanding of how to handle situations where the API returns more results than can be returned in a single call.
* Level 3 (harder but more scalable): Get all articles in the last ten years for all three journals in a single API call. This will be the fastest approach, but will require the more sophisticated coding (about the same level as 2) and deeper understanding of the API.
  * Hint #1: the `/journals/{issn}/works` endpoint we used in the tutorial limits you to one ISSN per call, but you want multiple issns. Is there another endpoint that will allow you to get all articles for multiple issns?
  * Hint #2: when you find the appropriate endpoint, you still need to *select only* the results in a fixed number of ISSNs. Another way of putting that is you want to *remove all* results that are not in your three journals of interest. I've carefully worded the italics in this hint to avoid giving away the answer, but if you can think of another wording for what I've said in italics and look for that word in the API documentation, you should be able to find the answer of how to do it. If it takes you more than a few minutes to find the answer, look at the endpoint description [here](https://www.crossref.org/documentation/retrieve-metadata/rest-api/) for a relevant hyperlink.

## Step 4 - Upload the assignment materials to the GitGub server

1. Verify that the assignment_2 folder has been created and contains the two python files, two CSV files, and one text file.
2. Commit the new folder and files to your local repository
3. Push the new folder and files to the GitHub server
4. Check that the file is now on the GitHub server by visiting your repository on the GitHub website

## Step 5 - Create an 'Issue' with a 'submitted' label

1. In the Issues tab create the ***submitted*** label
2. Create a new issue called ***Assignment 2 Submission***
    * with the submitted label
    * with the commit containing your assignment linked in the body
    * assigned to me (***amckenny***)
3. That's it!
